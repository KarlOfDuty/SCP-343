## Lore Friendly Description 
SCP-343 is a passive immortal D-Class Personnel. He spawns with one Flashlight and any weapon he picks up is morphed to prevent violence. He seeks to help out who he deems worthy. 
## Technical Description  

To be clear this isn't the correct wiki version SCP-343, its just a passive SCP inspired by my experiences of people being Tutorial running around messing with people.

Technically speaking hes a D-Class with godmode enabled or HP with the config option and spawns with the D-Class. After a X minute period set by the server he can open every door in the game. Also to make sure he is passive every weapon he picks up or spawns with is converted to a flashlight or something the server config can change. So people can know who he is, their rank is set to a red "SCP-343" and if they die or are set to a different class their rank name and color are reset to what it was orginally.
SCP-343 doesn't affect who wins.


If you see how stuff can be improved don't feel afraid to send me a pm or submit a issue.
